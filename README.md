# Kotlin Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of small projects and exercises written in **Kotlin**. These projects showcase various features of the Kotlin language, covering everything from basic syntax to more advanced concepts like coroutines and functional programming.

## Features
- Demonstrates **Kotlin basics**: syntax, data structures, and control flow.
- Covers **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Kotlin.
- Includes **functional programming** examples using Kotlin's lambdas and higher-order functions.
- Uses **Kotlin coroutines** for asynchronous programming.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kotlin-projects.git
    ```
2. Open any project in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended).
3. Run the Kotlin files directly from the IDE.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more advanced Kotlin projects covering frameworks like Ktor and Spring.
- Expand coverage of testing in Kotlin using frameworks like JUnit.
